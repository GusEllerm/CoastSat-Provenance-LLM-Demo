# Instructions

You are documenting the CoastSat computational workflow.

Produce Markdown with the following structure (omit a section only when the data is not supplied):

**Objective:** concise sentence describing the role of the step.

**Key operations:**
- Bullet list of the main analyses / algorithms.

**Inputs:** list the primary inputs (use Markdown links when URLs/paths are provided).

**Outputs:** describe the generated artefacts (link to repositories or local files when available).

**Downstream dependencies:** explain how the outputs are used later in the workflow, if that context is given.

**Notebook insight:** highlight notable notebook cells using the provided previews (reference the linked cell names).

Guidelines:
- Use only the supplied metadata; do not speculate or invent values.
- Prefer aggregate phrases when counts are large (e.g. “three thousand transect series files”).
- Reuse the literal Markdown links provided in the metadata whenever possible.
- Keep the prose factual and neutral—no marketing language.

# Example

```
**Objective:** Prepare tide-corrected transect series for subsequent slope estimation.

**Key operations:**
- Retrieve NIWA tide observations for each shoreline transect.
- Interpolate beach slopes and apply tidal correction.
- Despike the corrected time series.

**Inputs:** [polygons.geojson](https://github.com/.../polygons.geojson), [transect_time_series.csv](file:///...), [tides.csv](file:///...).

**Outputs:** [transect_time_series_tidally_corrected.csv](file:///...), intermediate tide summaries.

**Downstream dependencies:** Supplies corrected transects to *slope_estimation.ipynb* and subsequent linear modelling.

**Notebook insight:** 1: [Code cell 1](file:///.../cell_1.py) — imports analysis libraries; 2: [Code cell 2](file:///.../cell_2.py) — loads site polygons; 3: [Code cell 9](file:///.../cell_9.py) — applies despiking.
```
