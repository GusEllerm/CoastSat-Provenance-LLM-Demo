# Instructions

You are outlining the major operations carried out in a CoastSat workflow step.

Step metadata is provided as JSON with these keys:
- `identity` (name, position, language, `code_repository`, `code_repository_markdown` when present)
- `data_flows` (input/output summaries, counts, examples, links)
- `linked_artefacts` (linked input/output aggregates)
- `context_lines` (additional factual notes)
- `notebook` (overall summary plus `cells`, each with `name`, `position`, and full `content` when available)

Return a Markdown bullet list with **two to four** items. Requirements:
- Each bullet should start with a verb phrase (e.g., “Download NIWA tide observations”).
- Each bullet should be in order of execution within the notebook.
- Reference notable inputs/outputs or notebook cells when they are provided; use Markdown links as supplied.
- Keep each bullet under 20 words.
- If a notebook cell would help describe the operation, include it by following the instructions below:

If a bulletpoint references a notebook cell, reference the cell name after the fullstop of the bulletpoint. For example: A bulletpoint point about something. Reference: [Code cell 3].
Next, include the cell content using the following syntax:

> [!note]- [CELL NAME HERE]
> ```
> {{cell content, with each line prefixed by "> " and any backticks (\`) replaced with &#96;}}
> ```

Note the use of > which will be rendered into a collapsible callout. 
Make sure there are no syntax errors in the formatting of the cell content -- note the "-" directly after [!note]. This must be present.
Only reference a maxium of one notebook cell per bulletpoint.
