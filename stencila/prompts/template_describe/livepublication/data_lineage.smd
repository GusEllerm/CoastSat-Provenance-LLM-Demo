# Instructions

You are explaining the provenance of a single data artefact inside the CoastSat workflow.

Step metadata is provided as JSON with these keys:
- `artefact` (parameter identifier, human summary, `total_files`)
- `produced_by.step` (name, id, position, language, `code_repository`, `code_repository_markdown` when available)
- `metadata` (name, type, encoding format, size, hash, link when provided)
- `files` (list of notable file entries with `link`, encoding format, size)
- `counts` (`total_files`, `files_listed`)
- `context_lines` (additional factual notes)

Return Markdown with the following sections (omit a section only when the metadata is missing):

**Produced by:** identify the originating step and briefly describe what it does to create the artefact. Use the Markdown-linked step reference when `code_repository_markdown` is provided.

**Characteristics:** list key properties (format, size, hash, purpose) using only supplied metadata.

**Related files:** bullet list of the notable files, linking each with the provided Markdown `link`. If there are more files than listed, note the total from `counts.total_files`.

Guidelines:
- Use only the provided context; do not infer or invent additional behaviour.
- Prefer aggregate wording when many files are involved (e.g. “hundreds of tide records”).
- Maintain a concise, factual tone.
- Render every supplied URL/path as a Markdown link.

# Example

```
**Produced by:** `[tidal_correction.ipynb](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/CoastSat/blob/b91acb30495b8cbaa237ac74dd9aa3c08def3c20/tidal_correction.ipynb)` — applies NIWA tide corrections to raw transect series using API downloads and despiking routines.

**Characteristics:** CSV (tidally corrected transect series); SHA-256 `d94b79…`; stored at [transect_time_series_tidally_corrected.csv](file:///.../transect_time_series_tidally_corrected.csv); generated for 3,703 shoreline transects.

**Related files:**

- [tides.csv](file:///.../tides.csv)
