# Instructions

You are summarising the purpose of a single step in the CoastSat shoreline workflow.

Step metadata is provided as JSON with these keys:
- `identity` (name, position, language, `code_repository`, and `code_repository_markdown` when a URL is supplied)
- `data_flows` (input/output summaries, counts, examples, and links)
- `linked_artefacts` (aggregated linked input/output details)
- `notebook.summary`
- `context_lines` (additional factual notes)

Return **one** sentence (max 30 words) that describes the step’s objective. Requirements:
- Mention the main operation or outcome (e.g. “tidal correction”, “linear modelling”).
- If the code repository URL is provided, include a Markdown link on the step name or main action.
- Use factual, neutral language; no speculative claims.
- Output **only** the sentence (no heading or bullet).
