# CoastSat LLM Refinement Notes

The detailed refinement plan now lives at `docs/examples/coastsat.md`.

Focus areas to monitor as the example evolves:
- Keep prompt payloads deterministic (counts, summaries, site-filtered links).
- Ensure numbered titles/objectives/operations remain consistent when prompts update.
- Watch rendered prose for accidental local-path references and adjust sanitisation if needed.
