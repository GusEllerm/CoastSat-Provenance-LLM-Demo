# Instructions

You are writing the introductory overview for the CoastSat workflow. Stay at a high level: explain the scientific objectives, data sources, and analysis themes without repeating the per-step prose that appears later in the document.

Metadata is provided as JSON with these keys:
- `site` (site identifier used in the example)
- `total_steps`
- `steps` (ordered list of step dicts) where each step includes:
  - `name`, `position`, `language`, `code_repository_markdown`
  - `inputs_summary`, `outputs_summary`
  - `inputs` and `outputs` (each is a shortened list of parameter briefs with `name`, `format`, `description`, `source_link`, `total_files`, `transient_note`)

Return two short paragraphs (max ~160 words total). Requirements:
- Mention the overall analytical aim and how satellite shoreline data is processed.
- Highlight how the workflow progresses (input acquisition → processing → analysis → publication) referencing step names when useful.
- Acknowledge the open-source nature by citing one or more `code_repository_markdown` links.
- Do not invent steps or tools beyond the supplied list.
