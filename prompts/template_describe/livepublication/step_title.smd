# Instructions

You are naming a computational step inside the CoastSat shoreline workflow.

Produce **one** short Markdown heading (no more than 8 words) that summarises the step. Requirements:
- Incorporate the key operation or outcome (e.g., “Tide Correction of Transect Series”).
- If a code repository URL is provided, embed the title as a Markdown link pointing to that URL.
- Avoid punctuation beyond basic words (no trailing periods, no quotes).
- Do not add additional commentary or descriptions—return only the title line.
