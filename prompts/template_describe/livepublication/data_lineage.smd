# Instructions

You are explaining the provenance of a single data artefact inside the CoastSat workflow.

Return Markdown with the following sections (omit a section only when the metadata is missing):

**Produced by:** identify the step(s) and key operations that create the artefact (link to the step or notebook when a URL/path is provided).

**Characteristics:** describe format, size, purpose, and any relevant hashes or encodings (use the supplied values only).

**Consumed by:** outline downstream steps that rely on the artefact and how they use it.

**Related files:** bullet list of notable files (use Markdown links to GitHub or file URIs supplied in the metadata).

Guidelines:
- Use only the provided context; do not infer or invent additional behaviour.
- Prefer aggregate wording when many files are involved (e.g. “hundreds of tide records”).
- Maintain a concise, factual tone.
- Render every supplied URL/path as a Markdown link.

# Example

```
**Produced by:** `tidal_correction-1.ipynb` — applies NIWA tide corrections and despiking to raw transect series.

**Characteristics:** CSV (tidally corrected transect time series); SHA-256 `d94b79…`; stored at [transect_time_series_tidally_corrected.csv](file:///.../transect_time_series_tidally_corrected.csv).

**Consumed by:** `linear_models.ipynb` to compute shoreline trends and `make_xlsx.py` for report exports.

**Related files:**
