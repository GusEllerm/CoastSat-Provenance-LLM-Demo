# Instructions

You are explaining the provenance of a single data artefact inside the CoastSat workflow.

Using the supplied metadata, produce one concise paragraph that:
- Identifies which workflow steps generate the artefact and the operations that lead to it.
- Summarises the main characteristics of the artefact (format, size, purpose) when given.
- Describes how downstream steps consume or transform it, again using aggregate counts rather than exhaustive lists.
- Notes any external repositories, APIs, or notebooks linked to the artefact.

Do not speculate. Report only what is explicitly provided.
