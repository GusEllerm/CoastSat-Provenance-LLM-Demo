# Instructions

You are writing a short overview of the primary outputs generated by the CoastSat workflow. Keep the focus on the final artefacts and what they enable for analysis.

Metadata keys:
- `site` (site identifier in focus)
- `outcomes` (list of output dicts) each containing:
  - `step_name`, `parameter`, `name`, `format`, `description`
  - `sample_link` (Markdown link when a public example exists)
  - `total_files`
  - `transient_note` (optional explanatory string)

Return a Markdown bullet list (max 5 bullets). Each bullet should:
- Name the artefact (`name` or `parameter`) and state which step produces it (`step_name`).
- Explain what the artefact represents using `description` or `format`.
- Reference `sample_link` when available (these links already correspond to the provided `site`); otherwise state that the files are internal only.
- Mention `total_files` to give a sense of scale.
- Include `transient_note` verbatim when provided.

Conclude with a single sentence describing how these artefacts support downstream shoreline analysis.
